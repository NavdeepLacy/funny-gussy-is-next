    <p>
      The school wifi has a number of restrictions that are harmful to it's
      users (you can read more about this in our FAQ and About page) and
      therefore it is almost required to use a vpn. However, not all vpn's work
      and there is some risk associated with them, therefore we have created
      this guide to help those in schools with BYOD access, or those who have
      <a href="guest.html"> accessed the guest network</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a VPN?</h3>
    <p>
      A VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network, is an application or
      service that routes your traffic through a separate server. This is useful
      if you want an internet operator (our school in this case) to not have the
      ability to see your data or restrict access to the network.
    </p>
    <h3>Risks of a VPN</h3>
    <p>
      Routing your traffic through a VPN means that the VPN provider can see
      your activity if they don't apply the necessary restrictions, typically
      you want to avoid vpn's that don't have good policies. This takes time
      however, and requires diligent research.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages of using a VPN on the school network</h3>
    <p>
      Using a VPN on the school network can be good for circumventing
      restrictions, as well as keeping the county from learning your browsing
      history. A vpn can also minimize the risk of being tracked down by a
      network admin for using the guest network (but does not eliminate it).
    </p>
    <h3>Disadvantages of using a VPN on the guest network</h3>
    <p>
      However, VPN's do come with a disadvantage, including the fact that
      depending on the vpn, you will need to pay a decent chunk of money if you
      want good data and fast speeds. Plus there's definitely going to be a
      slowdown in your internet speeds, but depending on the situation it can be
      negligible at best.

      (All of these vpns should give you a reasonable expectation of privacy,
      however we can't verify that there isn't an NSA black box connected to
      their servers. You likely don't need to worry about this but we wanted to
      at least warn you first)
    </p>
    <h3>Windscribe VPN</h3>
    <p>
      Windscribe's vpn service has a good free tier, plus we know it works with
      the school network (when you select IKEv2 as the protocol, or the
      connection method).
    </p>
    <h3>ProtonVPN</h3>
    <p>
      ProtonVPN also works on the school network (when logging in at home or on
      cellular) and it has a decent free plan too, with unlimited allowance of
      free data.
