    <h1 class="centertext">Accessing Wifi in School</h1>
    <p>
      Wanna watch YouTube without being restricted by the County? Want to access
      Duckduckgo, Discord, or Signal to do a multitude of useful things that the
      County doesn't want you to do, like message your parents or friends,
      without using your precious data? Well, we at F.U.N.G.U.S. have a
      solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you know, the days of being able to use GCPS-Mobile at many schools in
      Gwinnett County are long gone. The county has disabled the ability to
      access GCPS-Mobile without authentication in each school that has chosen
      to disable BYOD. To make things worse, GCPS-Mobile is almost impenetrable,
      as each computer has a special configuration for access on the network,
      and it is difficult to reverse engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there is still hope, GCPS-Guest still exists, and the school
      admins have not done anything to remove it, so it's still available.
    </p>
    <h1 class="centertext">Accessing the Guest Network</h1>
    <p>
      Add a hidden network called 'GCPS-Guest' (case-sensitive). Usually you can
      do this in the WiFi settings menu of your device, by selecting an option
      to 'enter Wifi SSID Manually' or some such. We don't have the time - or,
      frankly, the energy - to provide you with a guide to it for each
      individual device, so that's all we'll give you. I'm confident you can
      figure that out.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting to the sign-in page</h3>
    <p>
      After you add the network, it will usually say 'network requires you to
      sign in' or some such, and you'll have to find out how to get to the
      sign-in page. If you can't find it, use this link
      <a
        href="https://clearpasscluster.gwinnett.k12.ga.us/guest_register_login.php?_browser=1"
      >
        here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating an Account</h3>

    <p>
      Once you are on the login page, click "create account." Here you can
      create an account with an E-Mail (you can also use a phone number, but
      it's a really bad idea, and not required). We highly reccomend mail
      services like <a href="https://www.mail.tm">this one</a> that give you a
      temp email address and are verified to work. The school admins do
      periodically check the wifi network and block emails from logging in, so
      it is best to use temporary email services. Plus, this ensures your
      anonymity, but for the first time you can always use your own email if it
      doesn't have personally identifying information.
    </p>

    <h3>Obtaining the password</h3>

    <p>
      You will receive a password through the E-Mail you use, and once you use
      that password you should be able to log in. However, be sure to try again
      a few times if it does not work (because everything used by GCPS doesn't
      work half the time) and maybe try creating a new account if you're still
      stuck. Once you are connected, you can use your device - whether it be a
      PC, MAC, or even a Nintendo Switch - with ease.
    </p>
    <h3>Circumventing Restrictions</h3>
    <p>
      Do note that typical school restrictions do apply, you can check our
      <a href="vpn.html">guide</a> on VPNs if you want more information.
      Otherwise, congrats! You now have internet.
    </p>
    <h1 class="centertext">Troubleshooting</h1>
    <p>
      If you have some sort of an issue connecting to the network, or you have
      an error, these troubleshooting guides may help you
    </p>
    <h3>I got an email without a password, it says the login failed, etc.</h3>
    <p>
      You have to create a new account. It seems impossible for GCPS to use a
      tool that actually works well, so sadly this is the case.
    </p>
    <h3>when I use the link for the login page, nothing works</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure you're connected to GCPS-Guest, also make sure no vpn is
      enabled. Worst case scenario try a different web browser. Also note that
      sometimes the network stops working and therefore you may need to wait
      until later.
