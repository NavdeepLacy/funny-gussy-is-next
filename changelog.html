        This is a general changelog just to keep track of website changes
        internally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 2.0: This update is a massive release with some new
        improvements. The focus was not to radically change website design, but
        instead just to make some general QOL changes to it. Btw, this changelog
        is now public for all users, hello!
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 1.4: Fixed major text margin issues, plus fixed even more bugs,
        the site now looks good for mobile and desktop use now, with little to
        no bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 1.3: Added different coloring and fixed some mobile format bugs
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 1.2: Mostly added changes to our explanations in the FAQ as well
        as modified terms, no code changes atm because it looks ok right now
        (fingers crossed that our website launch goes well).
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 1.1: Added changelog, added titles and borders for more pages,
        fixed margins for text, and fixed many formatting errors on mobile
        devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 1.0: Released new website design (we know it's buggy and broken,
        we just released it AAA game style).
