    <p>
      We (The Fungus Team) have written these terms that apply to our website
      (fungusproject.ga) and the rest of our materials to govern the use of said
      materials and detail restrictions
    </p>

    <p>
      1. You may not use the materials on FUNGUS to hack, deny service, or harm
      other people. The intent of the materials are for your personal
      protection, you may not use them for more than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. F.U.N.G.U.S. does not control you, it is your responsibility to make
      correct decisions, we are not responsible if you suffer the consequences
      of following our guide, however unlikely that we believe this will happen.
      If you do something just because we tell you to, you are an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. While we have no way to enforce this at the moment (trust me we're
      working on a solution), you are not allowed to access this website on any
      school computer, and not on the school wifi unless you are using a vpn,
      failure to do so will result in being blocked from the website.
