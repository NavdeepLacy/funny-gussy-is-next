        "On behalf of the Future, I ask you of the Past to leave us alone. You
        are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather."

        F.U.N.G.U.S is an invitation-only project that concerns itself with the
        recent GCPS decision to remove BYOD. We have three main goals.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Spread Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        While this is the least impressive of our goals, it is actually the most
        important. Most people are not informed of the spyware and immoral
        technology practices that the county implements on it's students. They
        do not inform people adequately, so we are doing their job for them.
        Informing people of these issues helps others safeguard their data, and
        is the most important goal of F.U.N.G.U.S.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Bypass Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        Annoyed that Duckduckgo is blocked for no apparent reason? Annoyed that
        you cannot access signal to text your family members, or discord to talk
        to your friends? We hear you. Our second goal is to bypass the school's
        wifi restrictions. While we understand the necessity of wifi
        restrictions, (stuff like porn or illegal sites should not be allowed in
        any case) the filters used by GCPS are unreasonable and spotty at best,
        dangerous at worst. In fact the recent removal of the BYOD network for
        most schools during the 2022-2023 school year and all schools
        2023-onward has only made this issue more apparent. Cellular cannot be
        accessed in many parts of the building, so what if there's a shooting?
        or another private personal problem. Or a student is being attacked by
        another student and no help is nearby? The solution that GCPS has
        presented is to use a school phone, but not only does this not work in
        many situations, like the one we just described, it can give the school
        more private info on students and parents, and will only increase the
        risk of your data being taken by the school, and breached in a security
        exploit (by the way, the school really needs to fix some of these, and
        needs to contact us using renahersch@gmail.com).
      </p>
      <h3>3. Protect our Data</h3>
      <p>
        Our last goal is to protect our data. Public schools have security
        breaches often, because they store such sensitive info but don't have
        the proper security protocols to protect it. Considering how many
        important documents have been leaked by school staff, we can assume the
        same for our school. While we can't stop the school from taking all of
        our data, some of it is important for them to have, but we can at least
        stop the school from knowing our browsing habits better than we do (and
        by extension, google and microsoft). This is our third goal, to protect
        our data, and yours too.
      </p>

        If you are ready to reclaim your privacy and safety, you can read our
        docs <a href="docs.html"> here</a>, and if you aren't ready to do that
        just yet, we aren't going anywhere.
