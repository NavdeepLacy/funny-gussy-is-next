    <h1 class="centertext">What the School can see on the Chromebook</h1>
    <p>
      Recently, most of us have been provided school-issued chromebooks.
      However, this comes with a large privacy risk and it is important to
      explain what information they can access (especially since they don't do
      so themselves).
    </p>
    <h3>What the school can see via Google</h3>
    <p>
      Google (the makers of the chromebooks) allow admins to see a decent amount
      of stuff on the chromebook, here is a comprehensive list.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Everything but inside the parenthesis is verbatim from
      Chrome://management on the school chromebooks)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">
        Who has used this device recently and when (This likely means they get a
        log detailing login/logout history and usage time)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Networking information such as ip addresses (semi-unique identifiers of
        electronic devices), network interface configuration, (this is
        unimportant to regular users) and connection quality (so they likely
        know more about your internet than you do).
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Device specifications such as CPU/RAM utilization (they can see what's
        using resources, as well as how much it's using)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Detailed system logs (This is the big issue, this means that every
        website you visit is logged)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Audio Peripherals Attatched (basically any headphones, wired or
        wireless, as well as speakers)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Peripherals attatched while you are logged in (any usb drives and other
        devices that are connected to the chromebook using a cable)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Printing History (This is funny, what do they think we're printing?)
      </li>
      <li class="list">Your device username and chrome username</li>
      <li class="list">Installed chrome extensions</li>
      <li class="list">Which Google play apps you have installed</li>
      <li class="list">
        Device Login/Logout History, including times and failed attempts
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Chrome remote desktop history (this does not matter, as it is blocked)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        They can also see actions taken with data flagged as "confidential."
        This is wierd, as eariler in the year this was not added. It appears
        that it reports things such as screenshotting, copying, pasting, and
        recording so called "confidential information" We have no idea what this
        is or what it is being used for, and a google support article was far
        from helpful.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Essentially, the county has a lot of information available to them
      already, but they also use extensions such as lightspeed filter agent and
      gopher buddy. These supply extra features (and privacy invasion) not
      available by default.
    </p>
    <h3>What lightspeed filter agent sees</h3>
    <p>
      Per our research, lightspeed filter agent, an extension employed by GCPS,
      can see this information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Individual screens of every student chromebook</li>
      <li class="list">
        What tabs a school chromebook has open (they can also switch tabs
        remotely)
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Recently viewed sites, including the top viewed sites of students as a
        whole
      </li>
      <li class="list">They can read and change your data on all websites</li>
      <li class="list">They can see the chromebook's location</li>
      <li class="list">restricts access to certain websites (even offline)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gopher Buddy</h3>
    <p>
      Gopher Buddy looks at very similar things to lightspeed, with the
      exception of how long you're on and off the computer.
