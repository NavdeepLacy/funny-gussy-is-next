    <p>
      You have been fooled, this is in fact not a section to donate to us, but
      instead a section to donate to other charities who are actually important.
      One thing that people never understand is that it is useless to donate to
      some random project like ours, when it is much more important to donate to
      people who truly help save lives and better our society. Yes, we believe
      our goal is important, but it doesn't matter if we're restricted to using
      our chromebooks if there are people who cannot get food to eat. This is
      why we do not accept donations.
    </p>
    <h3>Charities you should donate to instead</h3>
    <p>
      (Note that while F.U.N.G.U.S. looks at a charity before adding it here,
      it's still your responsibility to look into them first, we're not
      responsible if you make a donation you're not proud of)
