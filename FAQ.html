    <h1 class="centertext">FAQ</h1>
    <p>
      Read our about section and still have questions? well we have an FAQ to
      help guide you.
    </p>
    <h3>Who are you?</h3>
    <p>Concerned students</p>
    <h3>Are you a terrorist organization?</h3>
    <p>
      No, there's a clear difference between us and a terrorist organization.
      For one, we're not trying to instill fear, nor are we trying to harm
      people. Secondly, our only intent is to remove the GCPS wifi restrictions
      and restore BYOD access, as well as protect people from spyware that our
      great county uses on it's students. Our primary goal is to help people,
      not harm them. In fact, we've found multiple vulnurabilities on GCPS
      computers that should be brought to their attention, (seriously, GCPS, you
      really need to contact us, email renahersch@gmail.com so we can help fix
      some exploits).
    </p>
    <h3>Can I join you?</h3>
    <p>
      The answer is almost always no, unless you have decent technical skills,
      but even then you'll still have to find us, and it's going to be difficult
      to be trusted. We cannot risk revealing our identities to the county, as
      the administrators often stretch the rules as to what they can do, and
      could come after us. However, you can still help by messaging your local
      school, or emailing the school board. If enough of us complain, they
      surely must listen.
    </p>
    <h3>Which school district are you a part of?</h3>
    <p>Nice try school admins, better luck next time.</p>
    <p>
      In all seriousness though, we're part of many different schools, some with
      wifi, some without.
    </p>
    <h3>Isn't what you're doing wrong and unethical?</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that it is exactly the opposite. The removal of BYOD especially
      in an age where school shootings and emergencies are common, and the
      school APs cannot stop bullying (or care to stop it), it is clear that
      being able to contact parents and loved ones in time of crisis is
      important. Not to mention that making everyone use crappy school
      chromebooks only makes things worse for everyone, as the school could
      spend on higher-quality chromebooks for the kids that need them, while
      letting others bring their own devices and save costs. We are worried that
      the removal of the BYOD network harms school safety and the learning
      environment while doing little to prevent kids from being on their phones
      or playing games in class.
