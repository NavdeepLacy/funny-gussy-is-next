    <h1 class="centertext">List of Grievances</h1>
    <p>
      Here we have an official list of grievances, or issues that we have with
      GCPS as of recently. This mostly involves the removal of the wifi network,
      but recent actions have also uncovered more concerning information that we
      wish to discuss.
    </p>
    <h3>
      GCPS has removed our wifi, causing safety issues, inconveniencing
      students, and jeopardizing our education.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Clubs cannot use school wifi to schedule meetings, nor can students bring
      their own devices in. However, the most egregious issue that has risen due
      to this decision is a safety one. School shootings, while rarer than
      people think, still happen. If I'm going to die, you know damn well that
      I'm going to want to send a message to my parents, and if the county wants
      to stop that from happening, they are truly insane. Only a few people ever
      abuse the wifi, and it's clearly an overreaction to remove it and punish
      the many because of the few. We're fine with compromises, like stricter
      rules for phone usage, but we're not okay with being treated like little
      children just because a few of our peers act like they are.
    </p>
    <h3>
      GCPS has spied on us repeatedly, often without us knowing, or without
      explicit consent
    </h3>
    <p>
      GCPS employs extremely invasive spyware methods on their devices that they
      have forced us to use. Generally this issue wouldn't be as huge of a
      problem if we had a choice to bring our own devices, but we don't. Given
      how security is often not great at public schools, the fact that the
      school knows our browsing habits better than we do is concerning. We
      demand more transparency and only necessary tracking on students instead
      of these invasive, unnecessary methods.
    </p>

    <h3>
      GCPS Employs a wifi filter that does not protect the school, and only
      hinders our education
    </h3>
    <p>
      The wifi filters used by GCPS often block critical websites that pose
      little to no threat to the school. Things like discord should be okay for
      use during school time, just not in classrooms, and the fact that this
      isn't possible is rediculous. I want to message my parents using signal
      and if that is such a problem to the county, it says a lot about what
      their priorities are as a government body that is supposed to educate
      children. Not to mention that unecessary censorship in a place of learning
      just undermines the environment supposed to be fostered there.
    </p>
    <h3>Closing statement</h3>
    <p>
      Therefore, we, the FUNGUS team, and students of Gwinnett County, demand
      that GCPS immediately reinstate the BYOD network, modify the network
      filter to be more effective, warn people of tracking, and give a
      definitive list of information collected by GCPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      GCPS can either understand our motives and goals, and revoke these
      ill-concieved decisions, or they can fight an uphill battle and
      continually be outsmarted by a group of high-schoolers doing this in their
      free time.
